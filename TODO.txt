BETTER DATABASE INTEGRATION
-Need to refactor index.js to use callbacks with notes
-Need to refactor Note methods to use callbacks
-Need to rewrite dbNoteLink to then act as middleware for Notes and NoteHandler
    rather than as strictly a local state backup.
-Write tests to check that data is recovered after server failure.
    **This means writing code to securely fail the server!**
    
TEST SCALING
-Need tests to reference a datafile so more notes/queries can be added and tested
    -Datafile would be csv, where the top tow will be notes, and the other rows are test 
        queries with columns associated with if the note will be queried (with each option)
        
-Need a way to generate tests.
    -Since this requires very similar code to the code already on server now, this
        would simply be for integrating new code, where existing, working code can be used 
        to generate new tests.
        
BETTER DEPLOYMENT SOLUTION
-Block the 'tests' folder when deploying
-Any insecure code that would be needed for testing the server
    should be a part of the 'tests' folder. When deploying, not
    only should this code not be there, but the server shouldn't look for it.
